  <h3>The Prodigal Son – A Story of Unfailing Grace</h3>
  <p><strong>Luke 15:11–32</strong></p>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603398391048-15e946da4e7b?auto=format&fit=crop&w=900&q=80" alt="The Prodigal Son" style="width:100%; border-radius:5px; margin: 1rem 0;" />

  <p>Jesus tells of a young man who asks for his inheritance early and leaves home to live recklessly. He squanders everything and ends up feeding pigs, starving and ashamed. Realizing his mistake, he decides to return home—not as a son, but a servant.</p>

  <p>But his father sees him from afar, runs to him, and welcomes him with joy, not judgment. He clothes him, feeds him, and celebrates. The father says, “This son of mine was lost and is found.”</p>

  <p>This story paints a powerful image of God’s mercy—always ready to receive us, no matter how far we stray.</p>

  <p><strong>Motivational Lessons:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>No mistake is too big for God’s forgiveness.</li>
    <li>You are never too far gone to come home.</li>
    <li>God runs toward the repentant heart, not away from it.</li>
    <li>True love doesn’t count your past—it restores your future.</li>
</ul>
</div>

  <h3>David and Goliath – Victory Through Faith</h3>
  <p><strong>1 Samuel 17</strong></p>
  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577968894826-5f6642dc7b3d?auto=format&fit=crop&w=900&q=80" alt="David and Goliath" style="width:100%; border-radius:5px; margin: 1rem 0;" />
  
  <p>Young David, a shepherd boy, faces Goliath—a giant warrior armed with sword and armor. David comes with only a sling and five stones, yet he boldly declares, "I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty."</p>
  
  <p>With one stone, he defeats the giant. This is more than a battle; it’s a lesson that with faith, even the smallest can overcome the greatest challenge. David’s courage didn’t come from his size or weapons, but his unshakable trust in God.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Motivational Lessons:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Faith makes the impossible possible.</li>
    <li>You don’t have to be the strongest—just believe.</li>
    <li>Your greatest power lies in trusting God, not in your tools.</li>
    <li>Every “giant” has a weak spot. Face yours with courage.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Esther, a young Jewish woman, becomes queen in a foreign land. When a plot threatens to wipe out her people, she must make a dangerous choice: speak to the king without being summoned—something that could cost her life—or stay silent.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by her cousin Mordecai, she bravely says, “If I perish, I perish.” She risks everything and speaks up. Her courage saves her people and turns the tide of history.</p>

  <p>Esther’s story reminds us that we are often placed in certain positions “for such a time as this.”</p>

  <p><strong>Motivational Lessons:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>True courage means acting even when you're afraid.</li>
    <li>Your voice can protect others—don’t hide it.</li>
    <li>God positions you with purpose.</li>
    <li>One act of bravery can bless generations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Noah – Obedience in Uncertainty</h3>

  <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1613991955335-3b0e48e60d23?auto=format&fit=crop&w=900&q=80" alt="Noah's Ark" style="width:100%; border-radius:5px; margin: 1rem 0;" />

  <p>Noah lived in a time when the world had turned away from God. Yet God chose him to build an ark to save life from a coming flood. Despite being mocked, Noah obeyed. For years, he built the ark with no rain in sight.</p>

  <p>When the flood came, Noah and his family were saved. His obedience preserved life and started a new chapter for humanity.</p>

  <p>Noah’s faith teaches us that God honors those who follow His word, even when it doesn’t make sense to others.</p>

  <p><strong>Motivational Lessons:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Obedience sometimes looks crazy—until the rain comes.</li>
    <li>God may prepare you for what others can’t see.</li>
    <li>Faith is building when there's no proof yet.</li>
    <li>Your obedience can protect and bless your family.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Joseph – From Pit to Palace</h3>
  <p><strong>Genesis 37–50</strong></p>

  <p>Joseph was favored by his father, but hated by his brothers. They sold him into slavery, and he was wrongly imprisoned in Egypt. Yet through every hardship, Joseph remained faithful and honest.</p>

  <p>In time, he interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams and was made governor of Egypt. When famine struck, he saved many—including the very brothers who betrayed him.</p>

  <p>Joseph’s journey shows that God's plan often unfolds through pain, but ends in purpose.</p>

  <p><strong>Motivational Lessons:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your past doesn't define your future—God does.</li>
    <li>Delay is not denial; your time is coming.</li>
    <li>Bitterness blocks blessing—choose forgiveness.</li>
    <li>Sometimes what looks like a setback is a setup for elevation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Moses was born into danger, raised in Pharaoh’s palace, then fled into the wilderness. There, God called him from a burning bush to return to Egypt and free His people.</p>

  <p>Despite doubt and fear, Moses obeyed. With God’s power, he parted the Red Sea, led Israel out of slavery, and became one of history’s greatest leaders.</p>

  <p>Moses proves that God can use the broken, the doubting, and the wandering to lead nations.</p>

    <li>God doesn’t wait for perfection—He calls the willing.</li>
